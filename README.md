MB2 Log Reader Schema defines standard classes derived from the [MB2 dedicated server](https://moviebattles.fandom.com/wiki/Installation_%26_Troubleshooting_Guide) game logs. 
The point of this package is to make updating the spec easier for plugin developers.

## For plugin developers
To hook into the data generated by MB2 Log Reader you need an MQTT client, a way to unmarshall the raw XML and this schema.
